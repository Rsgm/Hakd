about
=====
This game simulates an entire internet for you to explore and mess around with all you want, legally.


This is not a game for eight year old kids who call themselves hackers on COD.
This is a game for those who wish to see what it is like hacking.
I encourage you to write your own programs to use in this game,
but I will leave that up to you to figure out.
