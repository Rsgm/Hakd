#Hakd
Hakd is semi rogue-like game about hacking, with a realistic, simulated, and procedurally generated internet.

[My to-do list.](https://trello.com/b/aPgl1zpo/hak-d) This also has some of my ideas.


###About
This game simulates an entire internet for you to explore and mess around with all you want, legally.

This is not a game for eight year old kids who call themselves hackers on COD.
This is a game for those who wish to see what it is like hacking.
I encourage you to write your own programs to use in this game,
but I will leave that up to you to figure out.
