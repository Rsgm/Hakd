Hakd
====

this is a game about hacking minus the penalties

this game simulates an entire internet that you can mess around with all you want



This is not a game for eight year old kids who call themselves hackers on COD.
This is a game for those who wish to see what it is like hacking minus the programming (but with the logic?).
If you want to take a step further, then I encourage you to write your own hacks to use in this game,
but I will leave that up to you to figure out.
