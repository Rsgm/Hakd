These are default scripts I wrote for this game.

Most of these are needed for the game to start and run.
I recommend not changing any or adding any of your own here.

Then again not much can go wrong(that can't be fixed with a re-download of the game) and this is about hacking, so do what ever you want.
Please don't hold me responsible for anything that happens.
