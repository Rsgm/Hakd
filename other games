hacknet(still in development):
-good game for what is done
-too short, but being worked on
-great ui
-free(for now I guess)
-for now the story is the only part
-not too open to mess around, I assume the multiplayer is more free

disrupt(still in development):
-I don't know much about this
-It may have only been started recently

uplink:
-I have played only one game, but lost pretty quickly
-very in-depth
-the text is a bit tough to see
-the ui is a bit plain
-I doubt they will have any updates
